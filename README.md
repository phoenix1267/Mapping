A cool app i made, the intended use was to help people keep a mapping for pokemon random map chalenge,but it can probably be used for any random map chalenges

-How to use : Edit Mode
	-first you will need to create your map, by default a small exemple can be loaded with a pokemon emerald map.
	to do so, import the .png file of the background in the folder \Mapping_Data\StreamingAssets,
	if they do not load properly in the app you might need to pass them by paint (open them in paint and save without modification, it as great chance to remove what cause the probleme)
	
	-second after your content is in the folder you can create your base map, to do so use the button in the top left corner to pass in "Edit Mode" ,
	use the painting brush to change the background of the current area.
	the small building button is used to create a sub area (like a city for exemple)
	the door icon is used to create a teleporter and can later be linked to a sub area for navigation
	for the right icon, 
	the brush and arrow is used to reload your asset from the folder
	the disk is used to save your creation 
	and finaly the folder one to Load
	
	-after your map is created, save it, to share it with your friends, you juste need to make them download the app and give them a copy of your "StreamingAssets" folder, you need to send all the folder, the txt file and all the .pngs
	
	-finaly have fun with your random map
	
	you might want to create the map ahead of playing or it will take some time,

			: Play Mode
	your map is now ready and loaded, you can click the sub area button to enter them and use the house button to go back to the main area
	for door button : if the door is closed, no link is made, any click will open the destination selector
					: if the door is open, a link exist, left click to teleport to the linked sub area and right click to edit the door destination
	
	you might want to duplicate your save file before using it, saving will also save the door teleport location and no reset button exist, so duplicate a clean save to avoid redoing it each time or having to clear each door by hand


feel free to use, just put a link to this repository if used for video/stream purposes
